# Exercise 1
In this first exercise implement a Cash Register Application using the above components that
processes input from the Keyboard and/or Scanner (Controllers) and outputs the product
information on the Display and TicketPrinter (Views) by interacting with the CashRegister
(Model). This design should follow a standard interaction pattern where the Controllers
depend on the CashRegister operators and the CashRegister depends on the View operators.
In this exercise I will be looking that CashRegister calls the operators in Display and
TicketPrinter
