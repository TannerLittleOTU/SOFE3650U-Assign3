# Exercise 3

Modify the original CashRegister,Display and TicketPrinter components from Exercise 1 so that an Observer pattern is used where the Display and TicketPrinter components are Observers to the CashRegister components and are notified when the current scanned productâ€™s name and price have been updated. This 3rd implementation uses a Subject / Observer pattern to invert the dependency between the Model and View.
